## Usage

When you run the CLI tool for the first time it will create a few new sub-directories, like `store` and `downloads` and `temp`.

### Download

Use this command to bulk download classic clothing from roblox catalogue. The cli tool will create a `downloads` folder in the same directory.

```sh
rocat download --amount 120 --type shirts
```

### Upload

Now you can upload the stored clothing to the website, the cli will keep track of the uploaded clothing, and will not re-upload clothing. Use the `--seo` flag to allow the cli to generate descriptions using an algorithm, better description can lead to more sales.

```
rocat upload --groupId 7830839 --limit 10 --seo
```
